# realTimeHTMLeditor
As a coding student, and therefore HTML student, when I'm trying new stuff it's very unpratical to always go back and forwoard to see what I've done. So I wondered "what if I could code and watch in real time what happens?". I searched and I found scratchpad, but I wanted something I could use offline. Did some research and coded this. Hope you guys like it
