## Real time HTML coding results? You bet!

It's a simple code, not that hard to do. But as a HTML student (I only began 1 month ago at the university), this was quite a challenge for me. I've never coded in JS, I just know the basics.

### Why I did this?

Mostly... for fun. But I really needed something like this.
As a beginner, sometimes I find it difficult to imagine what I'm coding, so I think this would help me in the future. Specially when I'm out of Internet or I just want to do some experiments!
